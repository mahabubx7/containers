# Containers [~/docker]

> Docker containers (personal) script/command as archive/backup

### How to use this?

First choose or find the target container and copy it. Then customize as you need. After finalizing follow this:

```bash
cat postgresql.txt | bash # directly executing through pipe using the Bash
```

Or, if there is no customize needed at all, then directly run this:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahabubx7/containers/refs/heads/main/<file_name>.txt | bash # use `sudo bash` if you really need
```

> Here, `file_name` is just a placeholder for container's names i.e. postgresql
